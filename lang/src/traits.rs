//! Core trait definitions for the Quasar framework.
//!
//! Traits fall into three categories:
//!
//! **Compile-time markers** — associate constant metadata with types:
//! - `Owner` — expected on-chain program owner for an account type
//! - `Id` — program address for a program marker type
//! - `Discriminator` — byte prefix for accounts and instructions
//! - `Space` — total byte size of an account's data (including discriminator)
//!
//! **Parsing and validation** — drive the account deserialization pipeline:
//! - `ParseAccounts` — parse and validate a set of accounts from raw
//!   `AccountView` slices
//! - `AccountCheck` — runtime validation hook called during parsing
//! - `CheckOwner` — verify an account's on-chain owner matches expectations
//! - `Owners` — declare valid on-chain owners for interface account types
//! - `AccountCount` — declare how many accounts a struct consumes
//!
//! **Access and dispatch** — provide uniform access to account data:
//! - `AsAccountView` — convert any account wrapper back to its raw
//!   `AccountView`
//! - `StaticView` — marks `#[repr(transparent)]` types safe for pointer cast
//!   construction
//! - `ZeroCopyDeref` — zero-copy `Deref`/`DerefMut` to `#[repr(C)]` account
//!   layouts
//! - `ProgramInterface` — check an address against multiple valid program IDs
//!
//! **Events** — `Event` supports dual emission (log-based and self-CPI).
